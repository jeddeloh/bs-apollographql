## Installation

### 1. `graphql-ppx`

We rely on Graphql-ppx for typesafe GraphQL operations and fragments in ReasonML. [Go to the official documentation](https://beta.graphql-ppx.com) for installation instructions.

You should now have a `graphql_schema.json` in your project somewhere. Make sure it's always up-to-date!

### 2. Apollo Client

```sh
npm install reason-apollo-client @apollo/client
```

### 3. Apollo-Specific `graphql-ppx` Configuration

Add the following under `bs-dependencies` and `graphql`, in your `bsconfig.json`

```diff
{
  "graphql": {
+   "apollo-mode": true,
+   "extend-mutation": "ApolloClient.GraphQL_PPX.ExtendMutation",
+   "extend-query": "ApolloClient.GraphQL_PPX.ExtendQuery",
+   "extend-subscription": "ApolloClient.GraphQL_PPX.ExtendSubscription",
+   "template-tag-return-type": "ApolloClient.GraphQL_PPX.templateTagReturnType",
+   "template-tag-import": "gql",
+   "template-tag-location": "@apollo/client"
  },
  "ppx-flags": ["@reasonml-community/graphql-ppx/ppx"],
  "bs-dependencies: [
    "@reasonml-community/graphql-ppx"
+   "reason-apollo-client"
  ]
}
```

- `"apollo-mode"` automaticaly sprinkles `__typename` throughout our operation and fragment definitions
- `"-template-tag-*"` is how we tell `graphql-ppx` to wrap every operation with `gql`
- `"extend-*"` allows `reason-apollo-client` to automatically decorate the generated modules with Apollo-specific things like the correct hook for that operation!

## Usage

The [EXAMPLES/](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-apollo-client/tree/master/EXAMPLES) directory is the best documentation at the moment (real docs are coming), but in short, the appropriate hook is exposed as a `use` function on the graphql module. If variables are required, they are the last argument:

```reason
module ExampleQuery = [%graphql {|
  query Example ($userId: String!) {
    user(id: $userId) {
      id
      name
    }
  }
|}];

[@react.component]
let make = () => {
  switch (ExampleQuery.use({userId: "1"})) {
    | {data: Some({users})} =>
    ...
  }
}
```

Other than some slightly different ergonomics, the underlying functionality is almost identical to the [official Apollo Client 3 docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/v3.0-beta/get-started/), so that is still a good resource for working with this library.

It's probably worth noting this library leverages records heavily which allows for very similar syntax to working with javascript objects and other benefits, but comes with a couple drawbacks.

- You may need to annotate the types if you're using a record outside of the exact place it is used, so we expose every type from the `ApolloClient.Types` module for convenience
- Bindings to methods on javascript objects work a little differently. You have to use the method function in the module for that type.

Example:

```reason
  /** Inspecting the types reveals this is a QueryResult.t */
  let queryResult = SomeQuery.use();

  /** I can destructure, pattern match, or access properties that are values like normal */
  switch (queryResult) {
    | {loading: true} =>
    /** do something */
  }

  /** But if I want to use a method on the javascript object,
      I need to use a function defined in the module for that type */
  queryResult->ApolloClient.Types.QueryResult.fetchMore;
  /** ☝️ Note that once you know the type, you don't have to go searching for it.
      Everything is accessible under ApolloClient.Types */
```

## Recommended Editor Extensions (Visual Studio Code)

[vscode-reasonml-graphql](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GabrielNordeborn.vscode-reasonml-graphql) provides syntax highlighting, autocompletion, formatting and more for your graphql operations

[vscode-graphiql-explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GabrielNordeborn.vscode-graphiql-explorer) provides a visual interface to explore the schema and generate operations

## Bindings to JavaScript Packages

Contains partial bindings to the following:

- [@apollo/client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client)
- [graphql](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js)
- [subscriptions-transport-ws](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws)
- [zen-observable](https://github.com/zenparsing/zen-observable)

While we strive to provide ergonomics that are intuitive and "reasonable", the intent is to also expose a 1:1 mapping to the javascript package structures if that is your preference. For instance, if you're looking in the Apollo docs and see `import { setContext } from '@apollo/link-context'` and you'd prefer to interact with this library in the same way, you can always access with the same filepath and name like so:

```reason
module Apollo = {
  include ApolloClient.Bindings;
};

// import { setContext } from '@apollo/link-context'
let contextLink = Apollo.LinkContext.setContext(...);
// import { createHttpLink } from '@apollo/client'
let httpLink = Apollo.Client.createHttpLink(...);
```

For comparison, this library packages things up into logical groups that have a consistent structure with the intent to be more disoverable and less reliant on docs:

```reason
// Make a generic link
let customLink = ApolloClient.Link.make(...);
// Specific link types are nested under the more general module
let contextLink = ApolloClient.Link.ContextLink.make(...)
// See, they're all the same :)
let httpLink = ApolloClient.Link.HttpLink.make(...)
```

## About This Library

Apollo bindings in the Reason / BuckleScript community are pretty confusing as a write this (July 14, 2020), so it's worth providing some context to help you make the right decisions about which library to use.

This library, `reason-apollo-client`, targets Apollo Client 3 and aims to take full advantage of v1.0.0 `graphql-ppx` features (still in beta) and is intended to be a replacement for `reason-apollo` and `reason-apollo-hooks` (all non-deprecated functionality should be here and more). You should avoid using those libraries at the same time as this one.

#### Alternatives

[reason-apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/reason-apollo), despite being under the apollographql github org, doesn't have any official Apollo team support behind it and currently seems like it may be abandoned. It binds to the `react-apollo` js package and some of the older apollo packages not under the `@apollo` npm namespace.

[reason-apollo-hooks](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-apollo-hooks) is the hooks companion to the `reason-apollo` library and binds to `@apollo/react-hooks`. Given the lack of development on `reason-apollo`, there has been a lot of active contribution pulling `reason-apollo` features in there. It's fairly battle-tested and it provides a nice, simple interface to hooks. It's not currently compatible with `graphql-ppx` v1.0.0, but there is a branch that adds basic support for it.

## Contributing

Lets work to make the Apollo experience in ReasonML the best experience out there! This is a solid base, but there's a lot of low-hanging fruit remaining—more bindings, docs, examples, tests, better ergonomics—there's so much left to do!
